# Gaining business insights from data using SQL

Codecademy Project
Warby Parker is a transformative lifestyle brand with a lofty objective: to offer designer eyewear at a revolutionary price while leading the way for socially conscious businesses. Founded in 2010 and named after two characters in an early Jack Kerouac journal, Warby Parker believes in creative thinking, smart design, and doing good in the world. For every pair of eyeglasses and sunglasses sold, a pair is distributed to someone in need.
One of the goals of this project is to analyze different Warby Parker’s marketing funnels in order to calculate conversion rates.
Quiz Funnel : survey table
Home try on Funnel  : quiz table -> home try on table -> purchase table

Using SQL, I have tried to answer the following questions:
1) Which questions have low completion rates in the survey?
2) Does increasing the number of pairs offered during a home try on session lead to an increase in sales?
3) If yes, does it have a similar effect across the two styles?
4) Which is more popular in Warby Parker eyewear - Men's / Women's style?
5) From the customers who don't choose any particular style of eyewear, how many out of them make a purchase after opting for home try on? 
6) Does pricing matter across styles?

This repository contains the commented SQL code and the slides (with answers to all the abovementioned questions) are available at https://juinerurkar.com/codecademy-warby-parker-gaining-business-insights-from-data-using-sql/

I thank Codecademy for creating this interesting project.
